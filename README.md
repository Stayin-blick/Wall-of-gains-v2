Welcome Stayin_blick,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!

a countinuation from project 1 - building the Wall of Gains (nft group website)

This website was created to help those that are in or are just entering the crypto space, our aim is to provide a place for people around the world to communicate share ideas and even possible make their own calls, but we also have our paid callers that have proven themselves time and time again that they know the space well. We welcome those of all ages in the cryptocurrency and NFT space, currently the space is full of teenagers that need the education we provide. the differences from the previous versions of the site are, new colour schemes, event listeners and the user of javascript to bring more interactivbility to our site allowing users to have a better experience.

￼

Features

Navigation bar: to allow a quick jump to the sections that interest the reader with a back to top bottom at the bottom allowing those once they’ve swipe to quickly get back to the top of the page. Color contrast is perfect allowing for the user to easily pick up on the words which allows for an easy smooth experience. through the revamp the header bar has been made into a consistent styke through out the webpages given a proffesional out look. new skills were tried using animation through css allowing buttons to highlight once an action occurs.

education 
consist of our 3 main areas in our coumminty that we look towards genereating profit, we clearly split this into 3 clear sections allowing those to either get a focused understanding of of their chosen asset to invest in or to develop a broader knowdlage base allowing for more opportunity to make profit. The audio file is a nice relaxing song as those first entering the space may be nervous so this was implemented to help settle nerves and help the user as they approach a new concept.
￼

About us:

this section provides the public on what our aims are as a community and a little sample of what we want to provid other what the discord group is and what they are planning to do the fact of that “64%” is there could also intrigue users and keep them hooked as they scroll down the page. Gives a little update for what we are currently doing and providing utility to the community.

￼ Video/links:

Videos and links are used within this website as not everyone is a reading type of learner we have listeners and visual learners as well, so to cater for our audience as well as trying to introduce more elements to keep the user engaged we embed a YouTube beginners guide from Coin Bureau, where he starts right at the beginning and explore the world of crypto currency. Those that prefer to learn by doing they can easily access one of the market places link in the html to explore. we have links to other pages which are located in the header this will take users to our memembership tab, currently we arent open for memberships but the page has been built, as we have two aspiring devlopers on the team we are slowly going to build and optimize the 'game section' as we develop

￼ Contact us:

As we are a community we want our users to be able to access and ask us questions any time of the day to make this achievable all of our team members personal twitter accounts are hyperlinked within their own template and we also have a link to the discord and twitter for Wall Of Gains. As the team members are from all around the world we will always respond quick.

unfixable Bugs:

I ran into a few bugs along the way, that prevented myself from being strict with time management, (hospital admission a illness), already working on this fixes in a relaxed setting as this will be used for our official website.


Deployment:

This site was deployed to GitHub pages. First in the Github repository, navigate to settings tab then select master branch in the source section. Select master branch and link is generated.

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
i used all resources to help me grow and to build the website from forums to websites tutorials and walk through, even other experienced developers have given 30 mins for a one on one call.
