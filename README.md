Welcome Stayin_blick,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!

an update of project 1 - building the Wall of Gains (nft group website)

Wall of Gains

This website is a version 2 of perviously submitted work to show skill development.

Wall of gains was created to help those that are in or are just entering the crypto/web 3 space, our aim is to provide a place for people around the world to communicate share ideas and even possible make their own calls, but we also have our paid callers that have proven themselves time and time again that they know the space well. We welcome those of all ages in the cryptocurrency and NFT space, currently the space is full of teenagers/young adults that need the education we provide.


Features

Navigation bar: to allow a quick jump to sections that interest the reader, whether its education or an interactive game of snake with a back to top arrow at the bottom of the page allowing those once they’ve reached the bottom of the site, to quickly navigate to the top of the page. Color contrast is perfect allowing for the user to easily pick up on the words which allows for an easy smooth experience this is further aided by hover styling. The audio file is a nice relaxing song as those first entering the space may be nervous as to how to spend their money in the crypocurrency ecosystem, so this was implemented to help settle nerves and help the user as they approach a new concept, its located at the top of the page which allows users to quickly identify and interact with.

Who are we, what are we doing in this space

About us:

Videos and links are used within this website as not everyone is a reading type of learner we have listeners and visual learners as well, so to cater for our audience as well as trying to introduce more elements to keep the user engaged we embed a YouTube beginners guide from Coin Bureau, where he starts right at the beginning and explore the world of crypto currency. Those that prefer to learn by doing they can easily access one of the market places link in the html to explore.

Game section:

this will eventually consist of multiple games for users to brag about their score in our discord. currently Snake is the only playable game we have available. the user uses the arrow keys to controll the snake. the snake cannot go back on itself and it cant travel off screen both of these actions will result in a game over prompt, cancel will freeze game state while ok will restart the game.

once the user loads the page, onec an arrow input is recieved the snake starts to move to conrol the snake they use the arrow keey to move it around the gameboard, the user must avoid the snakes head going into its body aswell as the gameboard boundry. the aim of the game is to grow the snake length as long as possible, the food location is randomised and will not spawn underneath the snakes body.

Bugs:

I ran into a few bugs along the way e.g. iframe not loading correctly due to the websites security protection (https://opensea.io/) which was resolved by using a different marketplace website.

Validator testing (HTML & CSS): No errors using both HTML validator and CSS validator Accessibility : alt text has been used in every image and link open up in new tabs allowing people to get back to our page easily.

issues with the javascript element behind the interactive game snake, creating snake with the game section page but user input would only start the game and therefore not control the snake rather the page. therfore snake was taken to a different page and game section page will be used to add additional games that also open seperate webpages.

further issues with images display files are linked properly and works in web preview doesnt work on deployed page. background color is used incase image doesnt display
